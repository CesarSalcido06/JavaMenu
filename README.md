While using this program specific paths have to be hard coded into the Write.java, Read.java, and Create.java for it to succesfully create, read, and write files(.text). Example path myObj = new File("/Users/cesar/Desktop/" + input + ".txt"); //specify path
You can also specify the path for a ".png" image to open with the menu. This can be achieved by hard coding the path Ex. "C:\User\Desktop\image.png".
